\subsection{Distributed Systems - Exam paper 2016-17 Semester 7}



\begin{enumerate}
   \item Question 1 (25 marks)
   \begin{itemize}
     \item  Using diagrams and examples where appropriate, explain the following terms as
they apply to distributed systems:(9)\\

Heterogeneity\\
Scalability\\
Transparency\\

\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}





     \item “A façade can be used to shield a client from the complexity of a distributed
system and promote loose coupling between service requestors and
providers.”\\


Discuss this statement. Your answer should address how session and message
façades can be used to aggregate services and increase the scalability of a
distributed system.(16 marks)\\


\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}


   \end{itemize}
   \item Question 2 (25 marks)
   \begin{itemize}


     \item “Marshalling frameworks based on highly structured unicode formats have
largely supplanted serialisation and binary data transfer formats.”\\


You are required to provide a critique of this statement. Your answer should
compare XML, JSON and lower-level marshalling formats in terms of
heterogeneity, extensibility and efficiency.(15marks)\\


\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}

\item Describe, using examples, the main roles and their function in both XML and
RESTful Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) .(6 marks)

\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}

\item Explain any advantages that a SOA may have over lower-level procedural and
method-oriented remote communication models.(4 marks)


\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}   \end{itemize}


   \item Question 3 (25 marks)
   \begin{itemize}




     \item  “C.J. Date’s rules for distributed databases define a set of objectives that
must be satisfied by a fully Distributed Database System (DDBS).”\\

Discuss the degree to which relational, wide-column and graph database
models can be considered to be fully DDBS using the criteria specified by C.J.
Date.(15 marks)


\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}


\item Explain how a distributed tuple store can exploit a hash-ring to promote both
high availability and scalability. Include in your answer a diagram showing
how a hash ring can be used to partition and locate database nodes.(10 marks)



\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}   \end{itemize}



      \item Question 4 (25 marks)
      \begin{itemize}





        \item Describe, using UML and diagrams where relevant, the function of the
following components of the RMI architecture:
   (9 marks)\\
   Remote Interfaces\\
   Remote and Dynamic Proxies\\
   Naming Services\\



\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}


   \item Discuss how RMI can be used to simulate a pass-by-reference. Your
answer should be accompanied by a diagram illustrating the component
parts involved in the process and code snippets showing the key
interactions.(11 marks)


  

\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}
  \item Briefly, explain how the RMI architecture can be adapted to enable direct
communication with a remote CORBA orb.(5 marks)


\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}

      \end{itemize}




         \item Question 5 (25 marks)
         \begin{itemize}





           \item Using a fully labelled diagram, describe the major components of an Object
Request Broker (ORB) and their function in the CORBA architecture. 
      (13 marks)


\begin{coloritemize}

  \item my answer
\end{coloritemize}
\item ) The following two Java interfaces abstract an PurchaseOrder and an LineItem
respectively. 



package ie.gmit.sw;\\
public interface LineItem {\\
 String itemNumber ();\\
 String name ();\\
 int quantity ();\\
 double price ();\\
}\\
package ie.gmit.sw;\\
public interface PurchaseOrder{\\
 String poNumber();\\
 void add (LineItem i);\\
 void remove (LineItem i) throws ItemNotFoundException;\\
 int count ();\\
 LineItem[] items ();\\
}\\


Translate the two Java interfaces into their CORBA Interface Definition
Language (IDL) representation and show how the IDL module may be compiled
and orchestrated into a set of server-side classes. (12 marks)
